It's past 02:45 AM, the perfect time to start a blog.<br/>
I haven't written anything publicly in a while. Probably since I was leading and managing a forum of software developers (which does not exist anymore) on a popular-yet-crappy Israeli portal around 2002 A.D..

!שלום, עולם<br/>
Hello, world!<br/>
Здравей, свят!<br/>

I am Alon Rotem, an Israeli living in <a href="https://goo.gl/PjAXm" target="_blank">Sofia, Bulgaria</a>. An amateur musician, a professional software developer and a geek wannabe.
More about me can be found on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/alrotem" target="_blank"><img class="nolightbox" src="/assets/img/old/facebook.png" /></a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/alrotem" target="_blank"><img class="nolightbox" src="/assets/img/old/linkedin.png" /></a> and <a href="http://plus.google.com/106241397435724804138" target="_blank"><img class="nolightbox" src="/assets/img/old/googleplus.png" /></a>. Sorry, I don't I don't <img class="nolightbox" src="/assets/img/old/twitter.png" />..
</p>

<strong>What is this blog?</strong>
<p>
I hack, crack and script all the time. I constantly write computer programmes, scriptlets, bookmarklets, macros, batch files and other automations regardless of whether they are needed or not.<br/>
Starting from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC" target="_blank">BASIC</a> programs on my first computer, my dearly beloved long lost <a href="http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8BITS/XL/800xl/800xl.htm" target="_blank">Atari 800 XL</a>, through smart automation scripts on the mythological <a href="http://www.mirc.co.uk/" target="_blank">mIRC chat client</a>, useful Microsoft Office macros, down to the latest <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/" target="_blank">.NET framework</a> Windows and web applications.
</p>
<p>
I intend to use this small virtual piece of cyberspace as my public notebook for scripts and sample programmes I often build. Someone may find them useful.<br/>
Random thoughts and posts about subjects other than code may also appear without notice.
This blog will be mainly written in English and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet" target="_blank">L33T</a>, as those are the official languages of geeks worldwide.
</p>

<p>
Welcome.<br/>
Happy coding.<br/>
Do help yourselves to booze cabinet.<br/>
