<p>
    
    This is a short lecture I gave on 01/2012 to the students of the Telerik Academy.
</p>
<p>
    The students who do well in the C# fundamentals course, in which I lecture, are offered jobs at Telerik. The job's pool is split into positions of developers, QA engineers and technical support engineers. Since Telerik's products are made for the usage of developers, knowledge of programming is required for all those positions (not just for the developers' positions).<br/>
    In order to give the students a better understanding of what they may be facing in the future, Telerik Academy conducted a short seminar in which a lecturing representative of each of the aforementioned position gave an introductory presentation.<br/>
    Representing the developers, I put together a short lecture, describing the everyday chores of of the poor developer.
