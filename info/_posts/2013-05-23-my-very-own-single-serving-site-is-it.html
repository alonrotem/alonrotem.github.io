subtitle: Is it 18:00 yet?!
---

<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/single-serving-site" target="_blank">Single-serving sites</a> are awesome. Well, some of them are. Some of them answer really crucial questions.

<h2>My contribution: <a href="https://alonintheworld.com/IsIt6/" target="_blank">Is it 18:00 yet?</a></h2>
<p>
    Sometimes you really really need to know if it's 18:00 already. My informative site "<a href="https://alonintheworld.com/IsIt6/" target="_blank">Is it 18:00 yet?</a>" is here to the rescue!<br/>
    It also shows a countdown till 18:00 (or a count-up, showing how much time has passed since 18:00).<br/>
    What else happens on the site at 18:00? I'll let you browse and see the wonder for yourself!<br/>

<h2>GitHub hosting</h2>
<p>
    This SSS is hosted on <a href="http://www.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (yes! it's possible!). A link to the repository: <a href="https://github.com/alonrotem/IsIt6" target="_blank">IsIt6</a>.
    To learn about GitHub hosting go to <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.
</p>

<h2>Other examples</h2>
<p>Here's a part of my SSSs collection. Some more useful than others.<br/>
    <em>Some links may be dead, as this is an old list...</em>
</p>

<h3>Informative:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Is it Friday??! If you really need to know the answer to this question, "<a href="https://isitfriday.org/" target="_blank">Is it Friday?</a>" is your place to go on the web!</li>
    <li>Well, if it's not Friday, "<a href="http://isitchristmas.com/" target="_blank">Is it Christmas?</a>" may try to give the next best answer.</li>
    <li>If it's not Christmas and perhaps not Friday, <a href="http://doesthemailruntoday.com/" target="_blank">does the mail run today?</a></li>
    <li>Has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider" target="_blank">the large hadron collider</a> destroyed the world yet? There isn't a definite answer to this question, since reality is nothing more than an illusion, as everybody knows. The operators of "<a href="http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/" target="_blank">Has the Large Hadron Collider destroyed the world yet?</a>" think they know the answer. The content gets automatically updated according to reports from CERN.</li>
    <li>Another cataclysmic option, in case the large hadron collider hasn't destroyed the earth (yet), is that the Icelandic volcano <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull" target="_blank">Eyjafjallaj√∂kull</a> is erupting (as it did in 2010). <br/>In any case, better check "<a href="http://iseyjafjallajokullstillerupting.com/" target="_blank">Is Eyjafjallajokull Still Erupting?</a>".</li>
    <li><a href="https://theuselessweb.site/thispeanutlookslikeaduck/" target="_blank">This Peanut Looks Like A Duck!</a> amazing, informative and enlightening. Hours of fun!</li>
    <li>How do you spell "definitely"? Go to <a href="http://d-e-f-i-n-i-t-e-l-y.com/" target="_blank">D-E-F-I-N-I-T-E-L-Y</a> and find out.</li>
    <li>Am I awesome? <a href="http://amiawesome.com/" target="_blank">amiawesome.com</a> sure thinks so!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Web and design:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>"<a href="http://sometimesredsometimesblue.com/" target="_blank">Sometimes Red, Sometimes Blue</a>" is a great website. Sometimes it's red and sometimes (when reloaded) it's blue. What more can a man ask for?</li>
    <li>If you're dizzy from the red/blue colour changes, "<a href="http://letsturnthisfuckingwebsiteyellow.com/" target="_blank">Let's Turn This Fucking Website Yellow</a>" is a more relaxed variant. It's just yellow.</li>
    <li><a href="http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/" target="_blank">Do websites need to look exactly the same in every browser?</a> A really helpful website for web developers and designers explains.</li>
    <li>Should web designers use tables in their layout? "<a href="http://shouldiusetablesforlayout.com/" target="_blank">Should I use tables for layout?</a>" is here to help you decide.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Useful</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A <a href="http://stopwat.ch/" target="_blank">stopwatch</a>. Because why the hell not?</li>
    <li><a href="http://count60minutesdown.com/" target="_blank">count60minutesdown.com</a> will count down 60 minutes. How awesome is that?</li>
</ul>

<h3>WTF</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.zombo.com/" target="_blank">Zombo.com</a> is one of the oldest SSSs.</li>
    <li>Then comes <a href="http://iiiiiiii.com/" target="_blank">iiiiiiii</a>, followed by <a href="http://ooooiiii.com/" target="_blank">ooooiiii</a> and <a href="http://lalalaa.com/" target="_blank">lalalaa</a>.<br/>The songs those samples were extracted from are are Hebrew songs, btw.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
