subtitle: Building a console-based game
---
<p>
    One of the projects provided as demos for <a href="/blog/2011/11/13/teaching-at-telerik-school-academy.html">my class</a> at the <a href="https://www.telerikacademy.com/" target="_blank">Telerik Academy</a> was a console implementation of the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)" target="_blank">Snake game</a> (they named it <em>JustSnake</em>). You can see it and some of its code on the screen recording of my lecture "<strong><em>Console Input and Output</em></strong>", which I will share here very soon.<br/>
    It inspired me to build my own little demo console game. I chose yet another classic game - the originally Russian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris" target="_blank">Tetris</a> which I named TeleTris. It took one evening of coding and debugging and I must say I am quite satisfied with the result.
